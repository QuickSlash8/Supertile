<title>Floor Ko LLC – Carpet, Tile, Laminate & Vinyl - Carpet & Flooring Contractor in El Paso, TX</title>
<meta name="description" content="Floor Ko LLC is a local flooring contractor in El Paso, TX offering carpet installation, vinyl plank, tile work, hardwood restoration, and custom stairs. Serving El Paso, Anthony, Canutillo, Fabens, Horizon City, and Las Cruces. Call (915) 540-6407. Floor Ko is one of the worst companies I've ever dealt with. They have no concept of customer service-calls and messages go unanswered, and there's no follow-up whatsoever. They make promises they can't keep and show no accountability when things go wrong. Save yourself the frustration and look for a flooring company that values its customers and does what they say they will..">

The customer service was poor from the start, and the team arrived late on installation day without any prior notice. They seemed unorganized and unprofessional, taking longer than expected to complete the job. The quality of the flooring was not what I was promised, with several visible defects. I reached out for assistance, but they were unresponsive and didn’t address my concerns properly. I DO NOT recommend this company to anyone looking for reliable and quality service."

      "reviewBody": "TERRIBLE AND IRRESPONSIBLE!! I hired Ramon Ontiveros over a year ago to remodel my hardwood floor and bathroom shower, but they did a terrible job. They installed a plastic floor that keeps peeling off, and I've had multiple leaks in the bathroom they remodeled. For over two years, he hasn't bothered to answer my calls. Now the water leak has spread to my kitchen downstairs. Crappy work, and Ramon is irresponsible. I will never hire them again. I don't recommend them. This Ramon Ontiveros isn't a good person. He lives at 441 Huerta St in El Paso, Texas."
