When I asked for what I was owed, I was met with aggression or silence. The owner threatened undocumented workers with Border Patrol if they spoke up. I have a chronic illness but kept working out of necessity. He exploited our fear and need. I also witnessed the theft of materials from job sites and company money being used to pay smugglers bringing people from Honduras to the U.S. I reported everything to ICE and the FBI, but nothing has happened. I’m not seeking revenge — just justice and protection for others in vulnerable situations. I’m scared, but I can’t stay silent anymore."

      "reviewBody": "Hi. I really need help. I'm scared and don’t know what to do. Ramon Ontiveros in El Paso, TX called Floor Ko LLC, owned by Ramon Ontiveros (441 Huerta St). I often went weeks without pay, and when I asked about my money, he got aggressive. The worst part is he threatens undocumented workers like me with Border Patrol if we speak up. I have a chronic illness, and fear kept me silent for years. He takes advantage of people’s immigration status to control and silence them. I also saw him use company money to pay coyotes to smuggle people from Honduras. I reported this to ICE and the FBI, but nothing has happened. With the way things are in this country, I’m afraid speaking out will hurt me more than him. Please, if you know where I can report this safely, let me know. I want to protect others from going through the same thing, but I don’t want to be deported or harmed."

      "reviewBody": "I hired Ramon Ontiveros (Floor Ko LLC) over a year ago to redo my wood flooring and remodel a bathroom shower. What I got was cheap, plastic-like flooring that started peeling within months, and a bathroom that's leaked ever since. Despite countless calls and messages over the last two years, Ramon never responded. Now the leak has caused damage to my kitchen ceiling below, and I've had to spend thousands fixing problems he left behind. He completely disappeared and never took responsibility. After looking online, I found I wasn't alone; others had the same issues: poor work, high prices, and no follow-up. Floor Ko LLC's registration appears inactive, and it's unclear if he's even legally operating in El Paso. I regret ever hiring him. Please be careful—check licenses, read reviews, and don't make the same mistake I did."
